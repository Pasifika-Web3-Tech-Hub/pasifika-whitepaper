## A PASIFIKA Token-Powered DePIN for Pacific Island Communities

**Version 1.0 | May 2025**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub represents a groundbreaking decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) designed specifically for Pacific Island communities. Leveraging the native PASIFIKA token (PSF) and built on Linea's zkEVM Layer-2 technology, this platform creates a sustainable economic ecosystem that preserves cultural heritage while creating new digital opportunities for islanders.

This whitepaper outlines our comprehensive approach to building a decentralized marketplace that connects PSF token holders, data providers, content creators, artisans, farmers, validators, and global consumers in a tokenized ecosystem that spans both digital and physical infrastructure.

The Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub addresses several critical challenges facing Pacific Island communities:

- Limited access to global markets for local products and services
- Vulnerability to climate change and economic disruption
- Risk of cultural knowledge loss and exploitation
- Limited technological infrastructure and digital inclusion
- Need for sustainable economic development models

Our solution implements a token-powered marketplace with integrated physical infrastructure (node operators, distribution hubs, craft documentation centers) and digital components (PSF token, Linea zkEVM, AI agents, marketplace, metadata systems) that generates real value while preserving cultural integrity.

   - Community discussion period before formal voting

2. **Voting Process:**
   - Regular proposals: 3-day discussion period, 5-day voting period
   - Constitutional amendments: 7-day discussion period, 7-day voting period
   - Implementation managed by relevant working groups

3. **Decision Thresholds:**
   - Simple majority required for operational decisions
   - Two-thirds majority required for constitutional amendments
   - Quorum requirement of 20% of total circulating PSF tokens for regular proposals
   - Quorum requirement of 30% of total circulating PSF tokens for constitutional amendments
   - Cultural decisions affecting traditional knowledge or practices require consent from relevant cultural authorities

4. **Implementation:**
   - Transparent execution through smart contracts
